This is the CodeBlocks project folder for the MicroGameEngine.

To run the engine in CodeBlocks take the following steps:

1. Download and extract the MINGW_extended bundle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Download codeblocks_v2_2016_2017.zip from Blackboard
Extract it somewhere on your harddrive.

2. Download and install codeblocks:
---------------------------------

* Fire up codeblocks
* Goto Settings -> Compiler
* Copy the "GNU GCC Compiler" setting to "GNU GCC Compiler MINGW EXTENDED"
* Make sure "GNU GCC Compiler MINGW EXTENDED" is selected in the dropdown box
